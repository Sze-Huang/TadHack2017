## Dependencies
- Vidyo.io API
- Digi Two-factor authentication API
- Microsoft Azure Bing Speech API

### [Vidyo.io](https://developer.vidyo.io/documentation/4-1-16-8/getting-started)
Vidyo.io™ is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to provide high-quality, real-time video communication capabilities. The service includes the VidyoClient SDK, which provides the APIs for integrating such communication capabilities into a variety of applications and workflows.

Some of the features of Vidyo.io include:
- Multi-party audio and video conferencing
- Group chat
- Application sharing

The VidyoClient SDK offers the same APIs on all supported platforms, providing a fast learning curve and enabling rapid development on all device types.

Connecting to the Vidyo.io cloud is done by passing a token from your application through the VidyoClient SDK to the Vidyio.io cloud. The token identifies both your application and the user.


### [Digi for Developers - Beta](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wWRcL7YIpaqDnN600ZHb14_yXtyO5bWQ2wGALmEUT9k/edit#)
Digi is a Malaysian mobile connectivity and internet services provider with over 12 million subscribers. Our ambition is to become Malaysians’ favourite digital life partner, providing relevant, personalised and engaging digital services. Digi is part of global telecommunications provider Telenor Group.

**Two-factor authentication**

GET /two-factor-authentication/msisdn

Generates a one-time use PIN and sends it to the user via SMS. PIN is a 4-digit numeric phrase.

### [Microcsoft Azure Bing Speech API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech/)
**Speech Recognition**
Convert spoken audio to text. The API can be directed to turn on and recognize audio coming from the microphone in real-time, recognize audio coming from a different real-time audio source, or to recognize audio from within a file. In all cases, real-time streaming is available, so as the audio is being sent to the server, partial recognition results are also being returned.

The Speech to Text API enables you to build smart apps that are voice triggered. To see how it works select your target language then click on the microphone and start speaking. Or simply click on one of the sample speech phrases to see how speech recognition works. When you use this demo you consent to providing your voice input data to Microsoft for service improvement purpose
